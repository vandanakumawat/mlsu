            Tourism industry has acquired a significant position in the global economy. Over the year, It has contribute in the development of economies of many countries in the world. Tourism industry provides employment, contributes in income creation, ecological conservation and regeneration of weaker sections of the society. Therefore it is felt that both quality and quality tourism would require trained professionals to man the various positions is the industry. The education system in India has still not considered Tourism as an important discipline. By keeping in mind, the need the create awareness among the masses to promote tourism and to provide trained manpower in tourism sector, FMS started one year diploma in 1988 - 89. After this, it was felt that the diploma was not able to fulfil the research and higher education. This led the need to design an exclusive course on tourism studies to help students pursuing systematic study of tourism as a career, at post graduate level as Master in Tourism And Travel Management by Faculty of Management studies, MLSU, Udaipur. The approach has been to provide a simple and comprehensive outline as many subjects as possible.
